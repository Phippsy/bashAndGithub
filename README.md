# Running Github code remotely

In this example, I'm demostrating how you would run code on a remote server without actually setting up version control on a specific file.

Here you would make all of your changes to a `shell script` and still be able to excute the remote file stored on github.

This is by no means a complete example and there probably are some modifications you would want to make, like encrypting your file for example.
